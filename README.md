# Sup? I'm Zoey!ðŸ‘‹

I'm open to make HTML websites for free as long as you don't want a super advanced website, like a search engine.
I also make native applications for Windows and macOS. Want a port of a site, lets say YouTube to a native app? I can do it.
I am a good coder of Minecraft plugins.
